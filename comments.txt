1. instantiate Express and assign your app variable to it. this variable is used to configure a bunch of Express stuff.
2. tells the app the location of its views
3. tells the app what engine to use to render those views (Jade)
4. tells Express to serve static objects (pages) from the /public/ dir, but to make them actually seem like they're coming from the top level (it also does this with the views directory). 
  For example, the images directory is c:\node\hackberry\public\images â€¦ 
  but it is accessed at http://localhost:3000/images
